   Major Releases
   --------------

Taking into consideration the length of the project, the rapidly
evolving cloud-environment, the need to offer stability to production
infrastructures and in the same time to address requirements from user
communities, the INDIGO-DataCloud major releases will be supported and
maintained for **10 months** after the release date. The availability of
a new major release of INDIGO-DataCloud does not automatically obsolete
the previous ones and multiple major releases may be supported at the
same time according to their negotiated end-of-life policies. Within an
INDIGO-DataCloud major release only the latest version of a component is
supported.
