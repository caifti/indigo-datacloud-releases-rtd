# jOCCI core v. 0.2.4 & API v. 0.2.6

**jOCCI** is a suite of Java libraries to facilitate use of the [OCCI (Open Cloud Computing Interface)](http://occi-wg.org/) protocol as 
standardized by OGF (the Open Grid Forum). Its main purpose is to simplify development of OCCI clients in Java.

The jOCCI suite consists of the following components:

* **jOCCI-core** is an implementation of the OCCI class structure in Java. It allows developers to work with OCCI concepts hands-on, treating OCCI classes as actual classes in their program.
* **jOCCI-api** is a library for OCCI transport over HTTPs.
